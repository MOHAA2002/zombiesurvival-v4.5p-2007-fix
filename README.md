# Zombie Survival v4.5p (2007) Fix
## Fixes:
- **Add files via upload:** Gamemode should be completely playable and free from errors in console. -Brainles5
- **Added Sound:** Recreated human win sound (humanvictory.mp3) by using ecky.wav dated from 2004 in v1.05 Fix. -Soldier
- **Fixed ENDGAME timer:** Intermission timer to changelevel somehow prevented NDB from saving. Move it to the end of the function and now it works. -Brainles5
- **NDB Replacement:** Fixes issues involving the NDB Database system that the gamemode uses. -Brainles5
## Improvements:
- **Add files via upload:** I changed the gib system to not use silentkill due to the flashy effect it causes, ruining the gore effect. Gibs should look better now. -Brainles5
- **Added Maps:** Newest GMOD9 supported maps or dating after v4.2. -Soldier
## Bugs:
- HL2 grenade duplicated with weapon_grenade.lua when spawned in map.
- Possible issues in saving user data. Will need more testing.
