# Zombie Survival v4.5p (2007) Fix
## Bugs:
### High Priority:
- Possible issues in saving user data. Will need more testing.
### Medium Priority:
- HL2 grenade duplicated with weapon_grenade.lua when spawned in map.
### Low Priority:
## Fixes:
- **NDB Replacement:** Fixes issues involving the NDB Database system that the gamemode uses. -Brainles5
- **Add files via upload:** Gamemode should be completely playable and free from errors in console. -Brianles5
- **Fixed ENDGAME timer:** Intermission timer to changelevel somehow prevented NDB from saving. Move it to the end of the function and now it works. -Brianles5
- **Added Contents:** Recreated human win sound (humanvictory.mp3) by using unlife1.mp3 dated from 2006 in v1.10. -Soldier
## Improvements:
- **Add files via upload:** I changed the gib system to not use silentkill due to the flashy effect it causes, ruining the gore effect. Gibs should look better now. -Brianles5
